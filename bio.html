    <p>I am currently reading for a <b>BSc (Hons) in Computer Science</b>, where I have contributed to projects such as Rewire, 
      a mobile app designed to help people reduce behavioral addictions. I am also conducting research on a Sinhala 
      speech-to-text model, narrowed to healthcare applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before moving into data science, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at Revoise, a startup where I first became 
      fascinated by the potential of data-driven solutions. That early exposure led me toward machine learning and AI, 
      and eventually into healthcare-related applications.
    </p>

    <p>Beyond technology, I enjoy long-distance trekking and photography. I especially love capturing architectural buildings, 
      sunsets, mountains, and coastlines. It’s my way of slowing down and noticing detail in both the built and natural world. You can find some of my work on <a href="https://vsco.co/yasithgwd/gallery">VSCO</a>
