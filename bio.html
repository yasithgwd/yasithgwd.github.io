    <p>I am currently reading for a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science, where I have contributed to data science projects such as Rewire, 
      an application designed to help people reduce behavioral addictions. 
      I am also conducting research on a Sinhala speech-to-text model, narrowed to healthcare applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before moving into data science, I worked as a trainee full stack developer at <a class="bio-link" href="https://revoise.com/">Revoise</a>, where I first became 
      fascinated by the potential of data-driven solutions. That early exposure led me toward machine learning and AI, 
      and eventually into healthcare domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of data science, I enjoy long distance trekking, being out for days with nothing but a trail ahead. 
      I’m also into photography, mostly capturing buildings, sunsets, mountains, and the sea. Some of my work’s on <a class="bio-link" href="https://vsco.co/yasithgwd/gallery">VSCO</a>.
